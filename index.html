        <h1>The most-played game on Steam.</h1>
        <p>
          The fans, they cry, they scream. With its billions of players, Poelsemix is the most succesful <abbr title="Aeon of Strife Styled Fortress Assault Game Going On Two Sides">ASSFAGGOTS</abbr>
          with thousands of (promised) characters.
          No matter if it's your first time playing or you've been playing for millions of hours, Poelsemix continues to be
          a game of interdimensional scale and depth. Regular updates ensure that Poelsemix keeps growing and continues to dominate the gaming market.

        <h1>An infinite battlefield.</h1>
        <p>Other games in the genre pretend to have 'Depth' or 'Diversity', but no game does it better than Poelsemix. 
           Poelsemix is not a game where you get played, it is a game where <em>you</em> play. With no enforced tactics, the game is yours to conquer.
           Play any hero you want, how you want — only creativity sets the limit. Poelsemix is endless.

        <h1>Free forever.</h1>
        <p>No one wants to pay for heroes, that would be stupid. It is only logical that all heroes are free — even before playing a single game — to even the playing field.
           All future updates and heroes are and will forever be free, no catch. No saving for five years to finally own the entire roster. In Poelsemix, buyer's remorse does not exist.
           Taking a break? No worries. Everything is still free.
